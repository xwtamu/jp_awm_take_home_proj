# jp_awm_take_home_proj
The take home project from JP AWM team

## folder structure
1. EDA_and_data_preprocessing.ipynb, it does EDA analysis and conduct all the required data processing step, e.g., outlier handling, missing value imputation, one hot encoding, feature engineering for the desc column, etc.
2. neural_network_modelling.ipynb, it builds the neural network pipeline to easily tune the models (e.g., different # of layers, # of neurons and activation functions, etc.) and compare the performance of those models through the validation AUC, then find the best performance model and submit its test results (in a separater email).

## how to run?
1. run the EDA_and_data_preprocessing.ipynb, may need to change the file path to point to the location where you stored the input train and test data.
2. run the neural_network_modelling.ipynb to load the cleaned data generated by the previous ipynb and dump the final test output in csv file.
